For example, .durations() returns a df of the durations of all the notes and rests in the piece, as shown in the cell below. The columns are the names of the different parts in the piece according to the score encoding. We can see that there are four parts, shown as columns. Musical time serves as the index (the left-most numbers) for the rows. They are notated in music21 offsets, which indicate the number of quarter notes since the beginning of the piece. So 0 is the beginning of the piece and the second row of the table (at index 8.0) contains an event in each of the first two columns. If there is no new events at a particular moment in the piece, it gets filled with a placeholder NaN."

        "Extending on the pianoRoll, the .sampled() method samples pianoRoll df at regular time intervals. It assumes the beat to be the quarter note and takes bpm and obs parameters to determine how often to sample the pianoRoll. The equation for the regular time intervals is (60/bpm)/obs. With the default values of 60 and 20 for bpm and obs respectively, this results in 20 observations per quarter note."
